Why choose an Amazing Cyprus Wedding Planner?

It can be a daunting thought and quite frankly possibly a scary one for some couples when considering using a company to arrange their most important day. Finding the right company you can trust to organise your wedding arrangements with great efficiency is no easy task! That’s why it is important to choose an Amazing Cyprus Wedding Planner! From the very first contact we aim to put your mind at ease by offering a professional, dedicated and personal wedding planner service that will assist you every step of the way. Your Amazing Cyprus Wedding Planner will play a vital role in assuring your wedding day runs as smooth as possible.

Your Amazing Cyprus Wedding Planner

Having previously worked as a wedding planner for a major tour operator in Paphos for many years our head wedding planner Mandy was able to bring along with her a wealth of experience, knowledge and organisational skills when joining Amazing Cyprus Weddings in 2008 accumulating 19yrs experience up to date so far!! Mandy feels fortunate to have a career she genuinely loves and feels excited about- stating “it’s a magical day that gives me great pleasure to be involved when I see it all come together and the emotion that comes with their day”. From the moment your wedding day is confirmed with Mandy she will be there on hand for you to personally answer any questions or queries you may have in record time and is only ever a phone call away.

The Personal Touch From Amazing Cyprus Weddings!

The personal touch means not having to deal with a change of wedding planners along the way….. frustratingly having to explain your plans time and time again. This can unfortunately happen quite often when booking through a hotel or alternative company. You will receive a personal service where we continue to oversee your entire planning right up and through to your wedding day providing you with essential peace of mind from beginning to end. Along with a committed and dedicated wedding planner service our company policy guarantees to arrange only one wedding per day, yours!
