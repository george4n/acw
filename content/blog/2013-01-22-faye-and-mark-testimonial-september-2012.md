Hi Mandy, Hope you are well. Not sure where to start with this post as there is so much to write! I think i should start with saying a BIG THANKYOU to Mandy on planning our wedding in Cyprus, we could not of done this without you and your excellent work, dedication and commitment you put into making our wedding a special day and a wedding to remember!

From the moment we met Mandy we knew we could trust her to plan our perfect day, We met Mandy in Cyprus last year and she took us to the hotel what we feel in love with and booked shortly after we returned home, from then on we was in email contact with Mandy on any questions we had and mandy was very quick in answering any questions we had and put us at ease through the whole planning stage, Mandy has so much dedication and commitment to her work and this shows when day arrives.

On arrival in Paphos Mandy met with us and took us to the town hall (which was in Polis) to finalise legal documents then onto our perfect wedding venue to make final plans, Mandy was in contact with us through the holiday ensuring everything was going to plan. Mandy planned and arranged our manicures, pedicures, hair, make up, flowers, musician, DJ, transport, hotel and all ran perfectly! Even carrying my lipgloss around to top up for photos.

My wedding day was stress free and perfect now not many brides can say that! that was all thanks to Mandy and my bridesmaids for sorting chair covers, table plans etc

We cannot thank you enough Mandy for making our dreams come true and our perfect day, we would recommend you to anybody that is thinking of getting married around Paphos area, please feel free to contact me if you would like any further information.
