know that by your simultaneous consent which is given publicly and formally in my presence and in the presence of the persons now here, accept each other as your lawful spouse and with the confirmation of this fact by your signature you contract a lawful marriage for all the purposes of civil law.

You should further know that your marriage cannot be dissolved during your lifetime except by a valid judgment of a court. If either of you (before the death of the other) contracts a marriage while this one remains undissolved he/she commits the offence of bigamy and is liable to the consequences provided by the law&#8220;.

</ol>

**&#8220; I call upon all persons here present to witness that I ……………………………………… accept you …………………………………………….**

** as my lawful spouse, to love and to share with you as from this day, moments of joy and sorrow, wealth and poverty, happiness and unhappiness, throughout our life until death do separate us&#8220;.**

  <li>
    Declaration by the Marriage Officer.
  </li>
</ol>

‘As from this moment I pronounce you man and wife. You are joined together by your free consent in matrimony and you owe it to each other love, fidelity and respect throughout your life. This marriage constitutes the fulfillment of your life and links your destinies on good and rainy days, in happiness and unhappiness, in wealth and poverty, until death do separate you.

On the basis of equality you should face together all the problems and all the difficulties of life. Together you should shoulder the burdens of marriage each one according to your possibilities. You have both the right and obligation to take care of the upbringing and education of your children so that they may become useful citizens with free personalities.
