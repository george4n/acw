It is a very hot day today reaching up to 35 degrees, we would always advise when choosing a Wedding Â in Cyprus during the months of July or August that you choose a late afternoon ceremony at possibly 5 pm or even 6 pm because the heat can be difficult for elderly guests and small children. By avoiding the main heat of the day yourselves and your guests will be able to enjoy your Cyprus Wedding celebrations.
