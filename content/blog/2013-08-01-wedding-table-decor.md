A very cost effective but totally effective way to decorate your reception tables can be to arrange water Gerba bowls. Gerba&#8217;s come in a variety of colours such as light pink, dark pink, bright yellow, white, light orange and burnt orange which really brighten up any wedding reception table decor.[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-884" alt="Red Gerbas in a bowl" src="http://www.amazingcyprusweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Red-Gerbas-in-a-bowl-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.amazingcyprusweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Red-Gerbas-in-a-bowl-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.amazingcyprusweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Red-Gerbas-in-a-bowl-435x290.jpg 435w, https://www.amazingcyprusweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Red-Gerbas-in-a-bowl-220x147.jpg 220w, https://www.amazingcyprusweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Red-Gerbas-in-a-bowl.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />][1]
