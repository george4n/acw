I got married in Paphos in Sep 2012 and it was fantastic. I was very worried at first about organising such a big event from the UK and decided to use a wedding Planner.

Mandy from Amazing Cyprus Weddings was wonderful and really made me have confidence that the wedding would all go without any major problems. I actually discovered Mandy&#8217;s details from the forums when I was looking for someone who seemed to have a good reputation and Mandy&#8217;s name came up again and again and now I realise why&#8230;.Mandy was attentive,friendly and really went out of her way to provide the wedding we wanted.

We got married in St Pauls pillars church and had the reception at The Thalassa. The food here and the whole evening was excellent &#8211; intimate , private and the food was out of this world.I really would not have any problems recommended Cyprus and Mandy if you are thinking of getting married in Cyprus , she works hard to ensure your day goes smoothly and deserves success in all she does -thank you Mandy and good luck .
