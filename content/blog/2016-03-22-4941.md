The Amazing Ayia Kyriaki Chrysopolitissa Church was built around 1500 AD as a Latin Church on the site of a small church which was destroyed in 59 AD by an earthquake. About 100 years after its construction and following the Turkish invasion of 1570, it became the Byzantine Cathedral of Kato (Lower) Paphos.

St. Paul and St. Barnabas visited Cyprus in 45 AD (Acts 13 verses 5-12) and converted the Roman proconsul Sergius Paulus and he became the first Christian ruler and Cyprus the first Christian country. Tradition has it that St. Paul was whipped in Paphos at the pillar near this church. Because of its history this Amazing Kyriaki Church is often referred to as “The Church at St. Paul’s Pillar”.

For many years now it has proven to be an Amazing Cyprus Wedding venue for both Anglican and Catholic Ceremonies due to the abundance of history, charm and character it offers.
