The newly wed Mr and Mrs Carpenter relaxing on 25th July 2012 who’s ceremony took place at Ayia Kyriaki Church

Well&#8230;..where do we start?! We have just got back from the best week of our lives! Mandy &#8211; we could not have asked for any more. You were amazing from the very first email right through to the tearful goodbye! Our wedding was what it was because of you! Nothing was too much and we are just so grateful to you for everything. We cannot recommend you enough to anyone who is thinking of getting married in Paphos! We really had the perfect wedding day! 

Thank you so much! We will keep in touch! 

Lots and lots of love,

Suzie and Chaz xxx
