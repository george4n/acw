**Cyprus wedding planner highly recommended**** **

Just a quick note to highly recommend the services of Mandy the wedding planner at Amazing Cyprus Weddings &#8211; we got married in Paphos

town hall in June 2012 & found her to be excellent. Having not visited Cyprus before we relied on Mandy to organise everything for us from the town hall service to the flowers, car and cake. Everything was done efficiently without fuss &#8211; Mandy responded quickly to all of our emails prior to our arrival and provided lots of useful information during our stay in Cyprus &#8211; she arranged just the special day we had hoped for and can be contacted on www.amazingcyprusweddings.com
