We have many wonderful memories of our wedding in Paphos, Cyprus thanks to Mandy O&#8217;Callaghan. Her services have exceeded our expectations and we have fond memories of both Mandy and our time spent there.

Mandy was professional and warm in dealing with our many queries and desires, and was able to guide and support us in making all decisions ranging from the selection of favours and accommodation for our guests, the handling of administrative documentation some of which was in Spanish, right through to the amalgamation of Greek Orthodox and Methodist Wedding rites.

The ceremony was Beautiful!

Her attention to detail was relevant and precise. She understood our needs and made suggestions when appropriate. Her experience as a wedding planner in Cyprus was evident on many occasions and saved us much time, money and turned many potentially frustrating moments into happy memories.

When the unexpected happened and we were faced with a medical emergency Mandy rose to the occasion and saved the day.

Extraordinarily diligent and persistent when faced with a difficult challenge Mandy went above and beyond the call of duty on many occasions. She is a valuable resource.

Thank you for the memories Mandy, we could not have done it without you.

We wish you every happiness.
