We would like to congratulate Emma and Nicholas who were married at the Almyra Hotel on the 10th August 2013. Here they are sharing a quiet moment together absorbing each other and their beautifully decorated setting before allowing guests to join them for their wedding meal&#8230;..Emma loves candles so had lots of them which added to their totally romantic wedding day in Paphos.[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-908" alt="BY5A5227" src="http://www.amazingcyprusweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BY5A5227-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.amazingcyprusweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BY5A5227-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.amazingcyprusweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BY5A5227-435x290.jpg 435w, https://www.amazingcyprusweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BY5A5227-220x147.jpg 220w, https://www.amazingcyprusweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BY5A5227.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />][1]
