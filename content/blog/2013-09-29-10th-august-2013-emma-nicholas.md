We recently got married at the Almyra Hotel & Spa in Paphos and cannot fault a single thing, where to start!

Everyone at the almyra hotel are so kind and helpful nothing was too much trouble with our every need attended to. Clean & Modern surroundings throughout the hotel and beautifully maintained gardens with all fresh fragrant herbs & plants. The food & drink is of the highest quality and our wedding meal especially was one to remember, thanks to the head chef Rob Shipman and great service by Przemek (smiler).

Our wedding planner Mandy from Amazing Cyprus Weddings who can be contacted on info@amazingcyprusweddings.com was brilliant from our first initial enquiry, a true gem! We must have emailed Mandy 1001 questions and she was only to glad to help, nothing was to much trouble and our day ran so smoothly thanks to Mandy and all her and the hotels hard work everything was all we had dreamed of and more. Anyone who is thinking about or is debating on getting married at the almyra then all we can say is to 100% go for it with Mandy and the almyra staff you will not be disappointed !

Mandy had also recommended other services as part of her team for hair, flowers, DJ and again we could not fault these, they also helped to make our day so special. Maria who knew exactly what style would suit me and compliment my dress, Paris for the most amazing, romantic flowers and venue decor/table settings we could ever of imagined and Karina the DJ who created the perfect atmosphere and music to make the party of our dreams. We also had a string duo called blue jar who played acoustic tracks for our ceremony and drinks reception on the kyma rooftops at the almyra they were again perfect and created a great ambience.

To summarise we couldn&#8217;t have done all this without Mandy and the perfect setting of the almyra hotel in Paphos! Cannot wait to return x
