For Anyone that is thinking of getting married in cyprus paphos. I would highly recommend using Mandy. Mandy was brilliant in helping plan my wedding. The day was just amazing and perfect, all thanks to Mandy!!. From the moment we were in contact with Mandy all the stress was taken away. There was lots of communication before hand, all questions were answered with a quick response and she was always available to discuss anything from paperwork, to organising a choclate sponge wedding cake.

When arriving in Cyprus we met with Mandy who went through every little detail. She even went beyond her job description and took us to the local supermarket, to stock up for our time in Cyprus, which she didn&#8217;t have to.

Mandy made sure everything ran smoothly, and can&#8217;t thank her enough for all her hard work and organisation that made our wedding day so special.

Our wedding day was perfect!!

So if you are thinking of getting married in Cyprus I highly recommend you get in contact with Mandy .
