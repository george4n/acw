> We had our Dream Wedding in Paphos in June 2011. One of the biggest worries for us was making decisions without meeting the person trusted to make sure everything on our special day was going to run like clockwork. Food , Venue , Paperwork the list goes on and on&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;My Beautiful Wife made everything run smoothly from the UK end and Mandy made sure all went to plan from the Cyprus end. From our initial contact via emails with Mandy she seemed to have all the answers to our questions which put our minds at ease and gave alternatives to hard to make decisions. She is very Professional and it was a pleasure to finally meet her when we arrived in Cyprus. Mandy has the knowledge of the local area and has many contacts within the local community which we found was a great help. There was no pressure selling as she listened to what we wanted and she catered for it with ease.

> Our whole experience with Amazing Cyprus Weddings was an enjoyable one . Her Personal , Professional and Caring attitude made our wedding dream complete which was commented on by our family members and guests alike. All I can say is if you are thinking about getting married in Cyprus/Paphos and you have any questions that are unanswered in your mind just drop Mandy an E-Mail and I know you will not be disappointed.

> Thank You Again Mandy ! Good Luck in the Future
