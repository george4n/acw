Hi Mandy, Just wanted to say a MASSIVE thank you for making our wedding day the most special day of our lives. Right from day one, you were extremely helpful and efficient in getting information to us, and nothing was ever too much trouble! This was evident when you spent hours the night before our wedding helping us decorate the reception tables!

The thing that struck us the most was the professional but personal service you provided both before, during and after our wedding. Everything run to plan amazingly (just how i like it as you well know ha!) and that was all due to your amazing planning and organisation skills.

You reallly are very good at what you do Mandy and we cant recommend you enough to people. So once again, a very big thank you for all your help with our wedding, and another special thank you for you taking the time to take us to the medical centre with my sick nephew. Nicola and Alex
