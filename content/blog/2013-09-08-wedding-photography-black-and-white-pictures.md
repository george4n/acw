Wedding Photography provides the perfect opportunity to offer alternative types of wedding pictures. You may decide you would like all your wedding photography to be in colour or to add black and white or sepia photographs. We have a choice of wedding photographers depending on your preferred style of wedding photography. Some couples choose to have a standard style where pictures are kept natural, others prefer edited pictures that provide a more dramatic kind of effect. Let Mandy our wedding planner in Paphos know what you have in mind for your treasured wedding day photography.
